## The Role of BeyondGrades

Throughout my high school life, I have struggled time and time again to find opportunities to help myself stand out against the student body and to build my skills outside of the classroom. At times, other students purposely withhold this information from me so they could access their knowledge. Putting others at a disadvantage instead of sharing with others and bringing everyone up.

In addition to the intentional “gatekeeping” from other students, unlike some more prominent or richer schools in the area, my school’s newsletter consistently failed to inform the student body of the opportunities available to them.

With BeyondGrades, I have collected many of the programs, opportunities, and groups available for high school students that I have seen throughout my years of experience and put them in one, freely accessible place.

BeyondGrades has all of the information on scholarships, extracurriculars, soft skill development, and some fields of study that I have devoted considerable time to.

I hope that BeyondGrades helps make the process of finding information to help everyone from career experience to high achieving students get ahead and build their resumes far easier and faster than ever before.

## About Me

I am a current 12th-grade high school student in Calgary, and I created BeyondGrades to be the wealth of information about high school opportunities that I wish I had when I started high school.
