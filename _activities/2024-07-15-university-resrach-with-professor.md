### Details
- Topic of research, how it will be conducted, and your role will likely be completely determined by the professor
- Over summer break, professors will usually be less likley to respond, or agree to requests
- Work with professor could possibly be in-person, but will likley be long distance

### More Info
- Contact professors at local institutions conducting research you might be interested in

### Pros
- Can be a great opportunity to get experience in research if that is your area of interest, as well as generally looking great on university or college applications
- Gain university connections and get to know the institution, and possible benefits and opportunities in the future through these contacts


### Cons
- Difficult to reach professors, and even more difficult to find any that are willing to take on high school students to assist in research if you do not have pre-existing connections with them or the institution
- ”Cold emailing” has a meager success rate
