### Details
- Can be taken both in class or independently of the school for the same price
- Moderate $160 fee for each exam, can be great value if credit is awarded
- Great way to learn more about a subject your school does not offer or does not offer at a high enough level
- Scores are not released until after the end of the school year, meaning that 12th-grade exams will likely not be seen by post-secondary institutions, but can still be used for credit
